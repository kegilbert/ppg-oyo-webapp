## CSV File Upload Mechanics

Dropzonejs is used in the frontend to allow users to drag and drop or select through their computer's file explorer a CSV file to submit for upload. Select the `Submit Data` field on the webpage's navigation bar and select your file. Once uploaded, the file is stored, parsed, and uploaded to Treasure Data. The server can then run jobs to pre-calculate the desired statistics for a range of time slots/locations and cache them on the server for display by the frontend.

### Sample Data Generation for CSV Submit

Sample data can be generated by either running:

```
curl "https://api.mockaroo.com/api/7dbeea60?count=75&key=98f39de0" > "Oyo.csv"
```
where count is a configurable value for the number of entries you would like to generate, or use the schema found at:

https://mockaroo.com/7dbeea60

The generated data will randomly generate reservations at three properties with unique users each time for the month of June. 30% of the entries will have cancellation dates in between booking time and the reserved start date. Cancelled rooms will not contain checkin or checkout dates.
